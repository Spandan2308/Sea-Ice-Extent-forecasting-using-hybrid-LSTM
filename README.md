Sea Ice Extent forecasting using Hybrid LSTM

    The 5 Arctic regions are used for forecasting are:
    1. Bering Sea
    2. Barents Sea
    3. Baffin Bay
    4. Greenland Sea   
    5. Kara Sea     

    The 5 Antarctic regions are:  
    1. Bell-Amundsen Sea
    2. Indian Ocean
    3. Pacific Ocean
    4. Ross Sea
    5. Weddell Sea

Lead Time of upto 12 months is used. RMSE and MAE are compared for the purpose of model evolution.

The NSIDC Monthly SIE dataset was used for the study.
